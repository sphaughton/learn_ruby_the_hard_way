<h1>Exercise 22: So What Do You Know So Far?</h1>
============================================

* ´´´puts´´´ (Exercise 1) - writes to the screen with a return
* ´´´"text"´´´(Exercise 1) - creates a string, whatever is between the quotes will become a string
* ´´´# (octothorpe / pound character)´´´ (Exercise 2) - used as a "comment character", anything that follows will not be seen
* ´´´+ (plus)´´´ (Exercise 3) - adds two elements together
* ´´´- (minus)´´´ (Exercise 3) - subtracts two elements
* ´´´/ (slash)´´´ (Exercise 3) - divides two elements, in strings is used as an escape character
* ´´´* (asterisk)´´´ (Exercise 3) - multiplies two elements
* ´´´% (percent)´´´ (Exercise 3) - modulo in math, string variables in print and puts statements
* ´´´< (less-than)´´´ (Exercise 3) - looks to see if it is true or false that one element is less than another
* ´´´> (greater-than)´´´ (Exercise 3) - looks to see if it is true or false that one element is greater than another
* ´´´<= (less-than-equal)´´´ (Exercise 3) - looks to see if it is true or false that one element is less than or equal to another
* ´´´>= (greater-than-equal)´´´ (Exercise 3) - looks to see if it is true or false that one element is greater than or equal to another
* ´´´=´´´ (Exercise 4) - assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left
* ´´´variable´´´ (Exercise 4) - a variable value, useful for identity purposes
* ´´´#{variable}´´´ (Exercise 4) - embeds variables in a string
* ´´´'text'´´´ (Exercise 5) - also creates a string, **however** string interpolation is only possible with double quotes
* ´´´print´´´ (Exercise 7) - writes to the screen **without** a return
* ´´´""" some text """´´´ (Exercise 9) - creates a string that allows the user to type as much as they want
* ´´´\n´´´ (Exercise 10) - new-line character
* ´´´\t´´´ (Exercise 10) - creates a tab
* ´´´gets´´´ (Exercise 11) - gets a string from standard input (whatever the user types)
* ´´´chomp´´´ (Exercise 11) - typically used with ´´´gets´´´, removes the new-line character
* ´´´to_i´´´ (Exercise 12) - converts output to an integer (a whole number)
* ´´´to_f´´´(Exercise 12) - converts output to a floating point (a number than contains a fractional part)
* ´´´ARGV´´´ (Exercise 13) - an argument variable, arguments passed to your script are stored in the ARGV array
* ´´´stdin´´´ (Exercise 14) - standard input, used with methods when using ´´´ARGV´´´ to differentiate between the two
* ´´´open´´´ (Exercise 15) - open a file
* ´´´close´´´ (Exercise 15) - close a file, while also saving
* ´´´irb´´´ (Exercise 15) - opens IRB (Interactive Ruby) in your shell, IRB is a tool to interactively execute ruby expressions read from the standard input
* ´´´read´´´ (Exercise 16) - reads the contents of a file, you can assign the result to a variable
* ´´´readline´´´ (Exercise 16) - reads just one line of a text file
* ´´´truncate´´´ (Exercise 16) - empties the file (deletes everything within it)
* ´´´write('text')´´´ (Exercise 16) - writes "text" to the file
* ´´´length´´´ (Exercise 17) - obtains the number of characters, elements, etc. in a file
* ´´´exists´´´ (Exercise 17) - looks to see if the specified file already exists or not
* ´´´def´´´ (Exercise 18) - create a function
* ´´´end´´´ (Exercise 18) - end a function
* ´´´seek´´´ (Exercise 20) - locate a particular spot in a file
* ´´´return´´´ (Exercise 21) - sets a variable to be a value from a function
