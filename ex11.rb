# Exercise 11: Asking Questions

print "How old are you? "
age = gets.chomp
print "How tall are you? "
height = gets.chomp
print "How much do you weigh? "
weight = gets.chomp

puts "So, you're #{age} old, #{height} tall and #{weight} heavy."

# Write another "form" like this to ask some other Questions

print "What's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
print "Where do you live? "
place = gets.chomp
print "And how long have you lived there? "
how_long = gets.chomp

puts "So, your name's #{name}, you live in #{place} and you've lived there #{how_long}."
